# 1. Introduction
With the rising demand for online food delivery services, companies like Zomato face increasing pressure to optimize logistics while maintaining high service standards. This project analyzes Zomato's delivery dataset, which contains detailed operational data including delivery timings, road and weather conditions, and performance metrics. The goal is to uncover operational inefficiencies, enhance route planning, and improve overall delivery performance through data analysis and machine learning.

# 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate key factors affecting delivery time and customer experience in Zomatoâ€™s delivery operations. By applying data analytics and predictive modeling, the project seeks to understand how internal and external variables (e.g., traffic, vehicle condition, delivery personnel rating) influence delivery outcomes. The insights will help inform operational decisions and improve efficiency.
# 3 . Outcome
This project will provide a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of Zomato's delivery system. Expected outcomes include:

1. Identifying the variables most strongly correlated with delivery delays.
1. Planning and strategies for peak times, festivals, multiple deliveries, and delivery staff performance.
1. Recommendations to improve delivery quality, customer experience, and logistics management.
